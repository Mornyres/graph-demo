# Graph search & traversal sandbox

Outdated as of now, moved to https://www.kaggle.com/code/forestleblanc/graph-algorithms and may or may not stay there

Just some fun with implementing and comparing graph search/traversal algorithms. Based on some graph traversal simulation code I wrote at an undergraduate research position.
For required packages: `pip -r requiremnents.txt`
